			"If you've ever wondered how those awesome apps on your phone are made, or if you've got an itch to create something fun and \
          innovative, the Mobile Dev Workshop is the perfect place to start! The main course of our workshop revolves around React and Flutter.  \
          These two powerful frameworks empower you to create fantastic, user-friendly, and visually stunning apps for both IOS and Android at  \
          once. We also will explore Google Firebase, a service that lets you effortlessly manage user data, authentication, and real-time updates.\
          With this software, you can quickly and effectively deploy fully functioning apps with minimal hardships. \
          But what's learning without doing? We've got an exciting coding activity for you! Get ready to roll up your \
          sleeves as you embark on a mini-project to create your mobile app. You'll apply everything you've \
          learned in a fun, hands-on session, and you might come up with the next big app idea!\
          No experience? No problem! This workshop is designed for beginners, and we will\
          be there every step of the way to help you get everything set up.",

			"Securing software requires developers to learn how to think like an attacker; you cannot defend against what you cannot\
        imagine going  wrong with your software. There are a wide variety of potential attacks, but \
        learning just a basic few can go a very long way towards improving your coding skills. In this workshop, we will participate in a \
        set of interactive Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges designed to demonstrate some of the \
        ways attackers think. Alongside hacking our machines, we will also learn some secure coding paradigms \
        to protect against these attacks. By the end of the workshop, you will have a newfound appreciation for the importance \
        of secure coding and be armed with the ability to build more secure software.",
